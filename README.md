# She is a Creative â€¢ Preferences
Software preferences, settings and other stuff I like to use in order to improve visuals and productivity.

## Code
- `/zsh`: personal prompt setup with branch name.

## Design

- `/Photoshop`: settings, actions, shortcuts, scripts.
  - `settings`: Shortcuts, workspace, UI preferences and Save for Web preferences.
- `/Indesign`: Workspace preferences.
